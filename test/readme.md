# Simple Mars Rover

I got this Kata from https://www.codurance.com/katalyst/simple-mars-rover

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.

This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their onboard cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

Your task is to develop an API that moves the rovers around on the plateau.

In this API, the plateau is represented as a 10x10 grid, and a rover has state consisting of two parts:

- its position on the grid (represented by an X,Y coordinate pair)
- the direction the compass is facing (represented by a letter, one of  'N', 'S', 'E', 'W')
- the starting position of the rover is '0:0:N'
